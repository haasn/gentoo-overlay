Autoplay gives each song a karma rating based on how often it adds that song, and how often that song is played.
Usually, bad songs have karma under 0.25, meh songs have karma between 0.25 and 0.60, and good songs are over 0.60. A song that is often added by the user to the playlist will have a karma over 1.
When a song is played, there is a cooldown time (default 12h) during which autoplay cannot add it. This way, the same songs cannot be spammed over and over.
