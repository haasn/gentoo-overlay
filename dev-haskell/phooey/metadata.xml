		Phooey is a library for functional UIs, providing three different
		functional interfaces: Monad, Applicative, and Arrow.  See the
		correspondingly named modules in the list below.  The other modules are
		exposed for extensibility.
		
		Try out the examples in @src\/Examples\/@.
		
		Because this library uses reactive, compile apps with @-threaded@.
		
		See also
		
		* The project wiki page &lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/phooey&gt;
		
		* Use of Phooey for composable interfaces in the TV library:
		&lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GuiTV&gt;
		
		* The implementation of data-driven computation (used in Phooey) from
		the TypeCompose library: &lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TypeCompose&gt;
		
		This page and the module documentation pages have links to colorized
		source code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user
		comments/.  Enjoy!
