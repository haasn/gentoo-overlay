		/Reactive/ is a simple foundation for programming reactive systems
		functionally.  Like Fran\/FRP, it has a notions of (reactive) behaviors and
		events.  Unlike most previous FRP implementations, Reactive has a hybrid
		demand/data-driven implementation, as described in the paper \&quot;Push-pull
		functional reactive programming\&quot;, &lt;http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/&gt;.
		
		This version of Reactive has some serious bugs that show up particularly
		with some uses of the Event monad.  Some problems have been due to bugs
		in the GHC run-time support for concurrency.  I do not know whether the
		remaining problems in Reactive are still more subtle RTS issues, or
		some subtle laziness bugs in Reactive.  Help probing the remaining
		difficulties is most welcome.
		
		Import &quot;FRP.Reactive&quot; for FRP client apps.  To make a Reactive adapter for an
		imperative library, import &quot;FRP.Reactive.LegacyAdapters&quot;.
		
		Please see the project wiki page: &lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/reactive&gt;
