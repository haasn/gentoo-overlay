		This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP libraries in
		Ruby &lt;https://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp&gt;,
		PHP &lt;http://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp-php&gt;,
		and Python &lt;https://github.com/singpolyma/OpenPGP-Python&gt;.
		
		It defines types to represent OpenPGP messages as a series of packets
		and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate
		encoding/decoding.
		
		There is also a wrapper around &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto&gt;
		that currently does fingerprint generation, signature generation, and
		signature verification (for RSA keys only).
		
		It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.  If importing
		both modules, something like this will do:
		
		&gt; import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP
		&gt; import qualified Data.OpenPGP.Crypto as OpenPGP
