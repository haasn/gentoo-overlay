		A Tardis is a combination of both a forwards and a backwards
		state transformer, providing two state values that \&quot;travel\&quot;
		in opposite directions.
		
		You can install this library with the @use-undecidable-instances@ flag,
		but this feature is only provided for toying around.
		If you depend on this library, or install any libraries that
		depend on this library, then you should install this library /without/
		that flag.
		
		A detailed description of what a Tardis is and how to use it
		can be found in the documentation for Control.Monad.Tardis.
