		An efficient implementation of Int-indexed arrays (both mutable
		and immutable), with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework .
		
		It is structured as follows:
		
		[@Data.Vector@] Boxed vectors of arbitrary types.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Unboxed@] Unboxed vectors with an adaptive
		representation based on data type families.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Storable@] Unboxed vectors of &#39;Storable&#39; types.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Primitive@] Unboxed vectors of primitive types as
		defined by the @primitive@ package. @Data.Vector.Unboxed@ is more
		flexible at no performance cost.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Generic@] Generic interface to the vector types.
		
		There is also a (draft) tutorial on common uses of vector.
