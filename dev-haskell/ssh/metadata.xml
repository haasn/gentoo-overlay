		This package was split from darcsden into its own project; documentation
		is lacking, but you can find example usage here:
		&lt;http://darcsden.com/alex/darcsden/browse/src/SSHServer.hs&gt;.
		This is not a standalone SSH server - it is intended to be used as
		a library for implementing your own servers that handle requests and
		authorization, etc. Similar to Python&#39;s Twisted Conch library.
