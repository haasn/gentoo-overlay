		This is a fairly simple implementation of a
		general-purpose spline library, just to get the code
		out there.  Its interface is still mildly unstable and
		may change (hopefully not drastically) as new needs or
		better style ideas come up.  Patches, suggestions
		and/or feature requests are welcome.
