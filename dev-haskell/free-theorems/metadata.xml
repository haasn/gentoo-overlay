	<longdescription>
		The free-theorems library allows to automatically generate free
		theorems from Haskell type expressions. It supports nearly all
		Haskell 98 types except of type constructor classes, and in
		addition it can also handle higher-rank functions. Free theorems
		are generated for three different sublanguages of Haskell, a
		basic one corresponding to the polymorphic lambda-calculus of
		Girard-Reynolds, an extension of that allowing for recursion and
		errors, and finally a sublanguage additionally allowing seq.
		In the last two sublanguages, also inequational free theorems
		may be derived in addition to classical equational results.
