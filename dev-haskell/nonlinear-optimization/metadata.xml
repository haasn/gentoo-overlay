		This library implements numerical algorithms to optimize
		nonlinear functions.  Optimization means that we try to find
		a minimum of the function.  Currently all algorithms
		guarantee only that local minima will be found, not global
		ones.
		
		Almost any continuosly differentiable function @f : R^n -&gt; R@
		may be optimized by this library.  Any further restrictions
		are listed in the modules that need them.
		
		We use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and
		matrices, although it would be possible to use something like
		@hmatrix@ easily.
		
		Currently only CG_DESCENT method is implemented.
