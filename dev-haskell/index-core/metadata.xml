		This library implements indexed types in the style of Conor McBride,
		described in the functional pearl \&quot;Kleisli arrows of outrageous fortune\&quot;,
		following his presentation closely.
		
		This provides a more general form of indexed monad than the one people are
		most commonly familiar with.
