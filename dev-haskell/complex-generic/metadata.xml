		The base package&#39;s &#39;Data.Complex&#39; has a &#39;RealFloat&#39; requirement for
		almost all operations, which rules out uses such as &#39;Complex Rational&#39;
		or &#39;Complex Integer&#39;.  This package provides an alternative, putting
		most operations into additional type classes.  Generating instances
		with template haskell helps reduce excessive boilerplate and avoids
		instance overlap.
