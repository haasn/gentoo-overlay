		Vectors are represented by lists with type-encoded lengths. The constructor
		is @:.@, which acts like a cons both at the value and type levels, with @()@
		taking the place of nil. So @x:.y:.z:.()@ is a 3d vector. The library
		provides a set of common list-like functions (map, fold, etc) for working
		with vectors. Built up from these functions are a small but useful set of
		linear algebra operations: matrix multiplication, determinants, solving
		linear systems, inverting matrices.
