	<longdescription>
		Implementation of natural numbers and integers by a
		binary representation. All functions are supposed to
		be as non-strict as possible. Furthermore the
		implementation is supposed to be reasonable efficient
		(in comparison to peano numbers). This implementation
		is inspired by a similar approach in the functional
		logic programming language Curry.
