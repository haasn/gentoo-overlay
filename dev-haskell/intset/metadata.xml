		This library provides persistent, time and space efficient integer
		sets implemented as dense big-endian patricia trees with buddy
		suffixes compaction. In randomized settings this structure expected
		to be as fast as Data.IntSet from containers, but if a sets is
		likely to have long continuous intervals it should be much faster.
