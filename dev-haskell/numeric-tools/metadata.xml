		Package provides function to perform numeric integration and
		differentiation, function interpolation.
		
		Changes in 0.2.0.0
		
		* Equation solvers now use custom return type.
		
		* Function to solve equations using Ridder and Newton methods.
		
		* New function to test approximate equality for doubles.
		
		* QuadRes contains best approximation achieved even if required
		accuracy is not obtained
		
		* Improve convergence test when integral converges to
		zero. Convergence is still poor
