		Atom is a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded software.
		Based on guarded atomic actions (similar to STM), Atom enables
		highly concurrent programming without the need for mutex locking.
		In addition, Atom performs compile-time task scheduling and generates code
		with deterministic execution time and constant memory use, simplifying the
		process of timing verification and memory consumption in hard realtime applications.
		Without mutex locking and run-time task scheduling, Atom eliminates
		the need and overhead of RTOSs for many embedded applications.
