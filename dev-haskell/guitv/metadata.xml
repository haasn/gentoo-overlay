		GuiTV is a very small library that extends the TV (tangible value)
		framework with graphical user interfaces, using Phooey.  (See
		&lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV&gt; and
		&lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Phooey&gt;.)  The functionality was part of
		the TV package up to version 0.1.1.  I moved it out to eliminate the
		dependency of core TV on Phooey and hence on wxHaskell, as the latter
		can be difficult to install.
		
		Try out the examples in @src\/Examples.hs@.
		
		For more information, including examples, please see the project wiki
		page &lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GuiTV&gt;
		
		This page and the module documentation pages have links to colorized
		source code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user
		comments/.  Enjoy!
